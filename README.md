<h1>Ancient GPS</h1>

Welcome to the Ancient GPS!

I built this app to illustrate the signficance (and satisfaction) of graph searching algorithms. It is important to know how they work as they play a vital role in guiding us to unfamiliar places or finding the most optimal path to familiar destinations like your place of work. 

Inspired by the ancient greek mythology of 'Theseus and the Minotaur', I implemented and visualised several famous algorithms such as Breadth-first-search and Depth-first-search as well as some cool maze generators to help see how theseus plans to take down the minotaur!

The app is very simple and intuitive to use. Have fun playing around with the settings to see the algorithms in action!
